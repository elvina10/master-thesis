\section{Geometric Set Cover}

In the geometric set cover problem we are are given
$\sets$ -- a set of objects, which are connected
subsets of the plane, $\points$ -- a set of points in the plane.
The task is to choose $\sol \subseteq \sets$ such that
every point in $\points$ is inside some element from $\sol$
and $|\sol|$ is minimized.

In the parameterized setting for a given $k$,
we only look for a solution $\sol$ such that $|\sol| \le k$.


In the weighted setting, there is some given weight function
$f : \sets \rightarrow \mathbb{R^+}$,
and we would like to find a solution $\sol$
that minimizes $\sum_{R \in \sol} f(R)$.

\section{Approximation}

Let us recall some definitions related to optimization problems
that are used in the following sections.

\begin{defi}
A \textbf{polynomial-time approximation scheme (PTAS)}
for a minimization problem $\Pi$
is a family of algorithms $\cal{A}_\epsilon$ for
every $\epsilon > 0$
such that $\cal{A}_\epsilon$ takes an instance $I$ of $\Pi$
and in polynomial time
finds a solution that is within a factor
($1+\epsilon$) of being optimal.
That means the reported solution has weight at most
$(1+\epsilon)opt(I)$, where $opt(I)$ is the weight
of an optimal solution for $I$.
\end{defi}

\begin{defi}
A problem $\Pi$ is \textbf{APX-hard} if assuming P $\neq$ NP,
there exists $\epsilon > 0$
such that there is no polynomial-time $(1+\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm
for $\Pi$.
\end{defi}

\section{$\delta$-extensions}

TODO PLACEHOLDER for introductory text

$\delta$-extensions is one of the
modifications to a problem, that makes geometric set cover problem easier,
it has been already used in literature (place some refrence here).

\begin{defi}[$\delta$-extensions for center-symmetric objects]
For any $\delta > 0$ and a center-symmetric object $L$ with
centre of symmetry $S = (x_s, y_s)$,
the \textbf{$\delta$-extension} of $L$ is the object $L^{+\delta} =
\{(1 + \delta)\cdot(x - x_s, y - y_s) + (x_s, y_s) : (x, y) \in L\}$,
that is, $L^{+\delta}$ is the image of $L$ under homothety centered
at $S$ with scale $(1+\delta)$
\end{defi}


The geometric set cover problem with $\delta$-extensions
is a modified version of geometric set cover where:
\begin{itemize}
\item We need to cover all the points in $\points$
with objects from $\{P^{+\delta} : P \in \sets\}$ (which always 
include no fewer points than the objects
before $\delta$-extensions);
\item We look for a solution that is no larger than the optimum solution
for the original problem.
Note that it does not need to be an optimal solution in
the modified problem.
\end{itemize}

Formally, we have the following.

\begin{defi}[Geometric set cover problem with $\delta$-extensions]
The geometric set cover problem
with $\delta$-extensions is the problem where for an input instance
$I=(\sets, \points)$,
the task is to output a solution $\mathcal{R} \subseteq \sets$
such that the $\delta$-extended set
$\{ R^{+\delta} :  R \in \mathcal{R} \}$ covers $\points$
and is no larger than the optimal solution for the problem without
extensions, i.e. $|\mathcal{R}| \le |opt(I)|$.
\end{defi}

TODO: Some text

\begin{defi}[Geometric set cover PTAS with $\delta$-extensions]
We define a PTAS for geometric set cover 
with $\delta$-extensions as a family of algorithms
$\{\mathcal{A}_{\delta, \epsilon}\}_{\delta, \epsilon > 0}$ that
each takes as an input instance $I=(\sets, \points)$,
and in polynomial-time outputs a solution $\mathcal{R} \subseteq \sets$
such that the $\delta$-extended set
$\{ R^{+\delta} :  R \in \mathcal{R} \}$ covers $\points$
and is within a $(1+\epsilon)$ factor of the optimal
solution for this problem without
extensions, i.e. $(1+\epsilon)|\mathcal{R}| \le |opt(I)|$.

\end{defi}
