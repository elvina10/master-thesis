In this chapter we show two fixed-parameter tractable algorithms
for geometric set cover problem in~two different settings.
Section \ref{section:fpt_unweighted} shows 
a fixed-parameter tractable algorithm for geometric set cover with unweighted segments.
The reminder of the chapter presents
a fixed-parameter tractable algorithm for geometric set cover with weighted segments
with $\delta$-extensions.
We show an algorithm for the setting with $\delta$-extensions,
because the original problem with weights is W[1]-hard,
as we show in Chapter $\ref{chapter:w1_hard}$.

We start with a shared definition for this problem.
We define \textit{extreme points} for a set of~collinear points.

\begin{defi}
	For a set of collinear points $C$,
	\textbf{extreme points} are the ends
	of the smallest segment that covers all points from set $C$.
	
	If $C$ consists of one point or is empty, then
	there exists 1 or 0 extreme points respectively.
\end{defi}

\section{Fixed-parameter tractable algorithm for unweighted segments}
\label{section:fpt_unweighted}
In this section we consider fixed-parameter tractable
algorithms for unweighted geometric set cover with segments.
The setting where segments are limited to be axis-parallel
(or limited to a constant number of directions) has an FPT
algorithm already present in literature.
We present an FPT algorithm for geometric set cover
with unweighted segments, where segments are in arbitrary directions.

\subsection{Axis-parallel segments}
You can find this simple algorithm in Parametrized Algorithms book \cite{platypus_book}.

We show an $\mathcal{O}(2^k)$-time branching algorithm.
In each step, the algorithm selects a point $a$ which is not yet covered,
branches to choose one of the two directions, and greedily chooses
a segment $a$ in that direction to cover.
This proceeds until either all points are covered or $k$~segments are chosen.

Let us take
the point $a=(x_a,y_a)$ which is the smallest 
among points that are not yet covered
in the lexicographic ordering
of points in $\mathbb{R}^2$.
We need to cover $a$ with some of~the~remaining segments.

Branch over the choice of one of the coordinates ($x$ or $y$);
without loss of generality, let us assume we chose $x$.
Among the segments lying on line $x = x_a$,
we greedily add to~the~solution the~one that covers the most points.
As $a$ was the smallest in the lexicographical order,
all points on the line $x = x_a$ have the $y$-coordinate larger than $y_a$.
Therefore, if we denote the~greedily chosen segment as $s$,
then any other segment on the line $x = x_a$ that covers $a$ can only
cover a (possibly improper) subset of points covered by $s$.
Thus, greedily choosing $s$ is optimal.

In each step of the algorithm we add one segment to the solution,
thus each branch can stop at depth $k$.
If no branch finds a solution, then that means a solution of size at most $k$ does not exist.


\begin{remark}
The same algorithm can be used for segments in $d$ directions,
where we branch over $d$ choices of directions, and it runs in complexity $\mathcal{O}(d^k)$.
\end{remark}

\subsection{Segments in arbitrary directions}
\label{segments_in_arbitrary_direction}
In this section we consider the setting where segments are not constrained
to a constant number of directions. 
We present a fixed-parameter tractable algorithm,
parametrized by the size of the solution.

\begin{tw}{
	\label{segment_cover_fpt}
	\textbf{(FPT for segment cover)}.
	There exists an algorithm that given a family $\sets$ of
	segments (in any direction),
	a set of points $\points$
	and a parameter $k$,
	runs in time $k^{O(k)} \cdot (|\points|\cdot|\sets|)^2$,
	and outputs a solution $\sol \subseteq \sets$
	such that $|\sol| \le k$ and $\sol$ covers all points in~$\points$,
	or determines that such a set $\sol$ does not exist.
}\end{tw}

We will need the following lemmas proving properties of any
instance of the problem.

\begin{lemma}
   \label{fpt_reduction}
   Given an instance $(\sets, \points)$ of the segment cover problem,
   without a loss of generality we can assume that
   no segment covers a superset of what another segment covers.
   That~is, for any distinct $A, B \in \sets$, we have
   $A \cap C \not \subseteq B \cap C$ and $A \cap C \not \supseteq B \cap C$.
\end{lemma}   
   
\begin{proof} Trivial. \end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
	\label{fpt_long_lines}
	Given an instance $(\sets, \points)$ of the segment cover problem,
	if there exists a line $L$ with at least
	$k+1$ points on it, then there exists a subset $A \subseteq \sets$,
	of size at most $k$,
	such that every solution $\sol$ with $|\sol| \le k$
	satisfies $|A \cap \sol| \ge 1$.
	Moreover, such a subset can be found in~polynomial time.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}

First we use Lemma \ref{fpt_reduction}.

Let us enumerate the points from $\points$ that lie on $L$ as $x_1, x_2, \ldots x_t$
in the order in which they appear on $L$.
Our proposed set is defined as: $A := \{ x_1, x_2, \ldots x_k\}$.
We prove this by contradition. Let us assume that there
exists a solution $\sol$ of size at most $k$, such that $\sol \cap A = \emptyset$.

Every segment that is not collinear with $L$ can cover at~most one of
the points that lie on this line.
Therefore, solution $\sol$ covers at most $k$ points on line $L$,
but $L$ had at least $k+1$ different points from $\points$ on it.
This contradiction concludes the proof that $|A \cap \sol| \ge 1$
for any solution $\sol$ of size at most $k$.
\end{proof}

We are ready to prove Theorem \ref{segment_cover_fpt}.

\begin{proof}[Proof of Theorem \ref{segment_cover_fpt}.]\leavevmode

We will prove this theorem by presenting a branching algorithm that
works in desired complexity. It branches over the
choice of segments to cover lines with \textit{a lot} of points,
then finally solving the small instance, where
every line has at most $k$ points by checking all possible solutions.

\subparagraph{Algorithm.}
First we use Lemma \ref{fpt_reduction}.

Next, we present a recursive algorithm. Given an instance of the problem:

\begin{enumerate}[label={(\arabic*)}]
\item If there exist a line with at least $k+1$ points from $\points$,
we branch over choice of adding to~the~solution one of~the~at~most $k$ possible segments
provided by Lemma \ref{fpt_long_lines}; name this segment $S$.
Then we find a solution $\sol$
for the problem for points $\points - S$, segments $\sets - \{S\}$,
and parameter $k-1$. We return $\sol \cup \{S\}$.
\item If every line has at most $k$ points on it and $|\points| > k^2$,
then answer \texttt{NO}.
\item If $|\points| \le k^2$, solve the problem by brute force:
check all subsets of $\sets$ of size at most $k$.
\end{enumerate}

\subparagraph{Correctness.}

Lemma \ref{fpt_long_lines} proves that at least one segment that we
branch over in (1) must be present in every solution $\sol$ with $|\sol| \le k$.
Therefore, the recursive call can find a~solution, provided there exists one.

In (2) the answer is no, because every line covers no more than $k$ points
from $\points$, which implies the same about every segment from $\sets$.
Under this assumption
we can cover only $k^2$ points with a solution of size $k$, which is less
than $|\points|$.

Checking all possible solutions in (3) is trivially correct.


\subparagraph{Complexity.}

In the leaves of recursion we have $|\points| \le k^2$, so $|\sets| \le k^4$, because
every segments can be uniquely identified by the two extreme points it covers
(by Lemma \ref{fpt_reduction}). Therefore, there are $\binom{k^4}{k}$
possible solutions to check, each can be checked in time $O(k|\points|)$.
Thus, (3) takes time $k^{O(k)}$.


In this branching algorithm our parameter $k$ is decreased with every
recursive call, so we have at most $k$ levels of recursion with
branching over $k$ possibilites. Candidates to branch over
can be found on each level in time $O((|\points|\cdot|\sets|)^2)$.

Reduction from Lemma \ref{fpt_reduction} can be implemented in time $O(|\points|^2|\sets|)$.

It follows that the overall complexity is $O((|\points|\cdot|\sets|)^2 \cdot k^{O(k)})$
\end{proof}
