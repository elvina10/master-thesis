	\textbf{Weighted geometric set cover is W[1]-hard}.

\begin{proof}
Trivial from Theorem \ref{w1_hard}. 
\end{proof}

In order to prove theorem \ref{w1_hard} we will show reduction from grid tiling problem.

\begin{defi}
In the \textbf{grid tiling} problem we are given integers $n$ and $k$,
and a function
$f : \{1 \ldots k\} \times \{1 \ldots k\} \rightarrow \mathcal{P}(\{1 \ldots n\} \times \{1 \ldots n\})$
specifying the set of allowed tiles for each cell of a $k \times k$ grid.
The task is to find functions
$x,y : \{1 \ldots k\} \rightarrow \{1 \ldots n\}$
that assign numbers from $\{1 \ldots n\}$
to respectively rows and columns of the grid,
so that $(x(i), y(j)) \in f(i, j)$ for all valid $i$ and $j$,
or conclude that such assignment does not exist.
\end{defi}


\begin{tw}
\label{grid_tiling_w1_hard}
Assuming ETH, there is no algorithm for grid tiling problem
$f(k)\cdot n^{o(\sqrt{k})}$
for any computable function $f$.
\end{tw}

TODO: proof from reference in literature

Let us have an instance of grid tiling problem -- size of the
grid $k$, number of colors $n$
and function of allowed tiles
$f : \{1 \ldots k\} \times \{1 \ldots k\} \rightarrow \{1 \ldots n\} \times \{1 \ldots n\}$.

TODO: nice picture of instance of grid tiling with solution

\paragraph{Construction.}
We construct an instance of Geometric Set Cover with segments in 3 directions
with weights $(\points, \sets, w)$.

First let us choose any ordering of $n^2$ elements
and denote it as bijective function
$order : \{1 \ldots n\} \times \{1 \ldots n\} \rightarrow \{1 \ldots n^2\}$.

Define $match_v(i, j)$ and $match_h(i, j)$
as functions denoting whether two points share x or y coordinate.

$$match_v(i, j) \iff
order^{-1}(i) = \{x_i, y_i\} \land order^{-1}(j) = \{x_j, y_j\} \land x_i = x_j$$

$$match_h(i, j) \iff
order^{-1}(i) = \{x_i, y_i\} \land order^{-1}(j) = \{x_j, y_j\} \land y_i = y_j$$


\subparagraph{Points.}

Define points:
	$$h_{i, j, t} = (i \cdot (n^2+1) + t, j \cdot (n^2+1))$$
	$$v_{i, j, t} = (i \cdot (n^2+1), j \cdot (n^2+1) + t)$$
	
Let's define sets $H$ and $V$ as:
$$H = \{h_{i, j, t} : 1 \le i, j, \le k, 1 \le t \le n^2\}$$
$$V = \{v_{i, j, t} : 1 \le i, j, \le k, 1 \le t \le n^2\}$$
	
Let us define $\epsilon = \frac{1}{2k^2}$.
For a point $p = \{x, y\}$ we define points:
$$p^{L} = \{x - \epsilon, y\},$$
$$p^{R} = \{x + \epsilon, y\},$$
$$p^{U} = \{x, y + \epsilon\},$$
$$p^{D} = \{x, y - \epsilon\}.$$

Then we define:
$$\points := H \cup \{p^L : p \in H\} \cup \{p^R : p \in H\}
\cup V \cup \{p^U : p \in V\} \cup \{p^D : p \in V\} $$


\subparagraph{Segments.}
Define horizontal segments.

$$\hor{i}{j}{t_1}{t_2} = (h^R_{i,j,t_1}, h^L_{i+1, j, t_2})$$
$$\ver{i}{j}{t_1}{t_2} = (v^D_{i,j,t_1}, v^U_{i, j+1, t_2})$$

$$\horbeg{i}{t} = (h^L_{1, i, 1}, h^L_{1, i, t})$$
$$\horend{i}{t} = (h^R_{k, i, t}, h^R_{k, i, n^2})$$

$$\verbeg{i}{t} = (v^U_{i, 1, 1}, v^U_{i, 1, t})$$
$$\verend{i}{t} = (v^D_{i, k, t}, v^D_{i, k, n^2})$$

\begin{eqnarray*}
HOR &= &\{\hor{i}{j}{t_1}{t_2} : 1 \le i < k, 1 \le j \le k,
1 \le t_1, t_2 \le n^2, match_h(t_1, t_2)\} \\
&\cup &\{\horbeg{i}{t} : 1 \le i \le k, 1 \le t \le n^2\}
\\
&\cup &\{\horend{i}{t} : 1 \le i \le k, 1 \le t \le n^2\}
\end{eqnarray*}

\begin{eqnarray*}
VER &= &\{\ver{i}{j}{t_1}{t_2} : 1 \le i \le k, 1 \le j < k,
1 \le t_1, t_2 \le n^2, match_v(t_1, t_2)\} \\
&\cup &\{\verbeg{i}{t} : 1 \le i \le k, 1 \le t \le n^2\}
\\
&\cup &\{\verend{i}{t} : 1 \le i \le k, 1 \le t \le n^2\}
\end{eqnarray*}

$$DIAG := \{ (h_{i, j, t}, v_{i, j, t}) :
	1 \le i, j \le k, 1 \le t \le n^2, a_t \in f(i, j)\}$$

TODO: explain that these segments are in fact diagonal

$$\sets := HOR \cup VER \cup DIAG$$

Weight function is equal to length of the segment for $HOR$ and $VER$
and equal to $\delta = \frac{1}{4k^4}$ for $DIAG$.

TODO: Put a picture of small instance like 3x3 with n=2

\begin{equation}
w(s) =
	\begin{cases*}
	  |s| 			& if $s \in HOR \cup VER$ \\
	  \delta        & if $s \in DIAG$
	\end{cases*}
\end{equation}

\newcommand{\solWeight}{2k^2(n^2+1) - 4k^2\epsilon -4k(1-\epsilon) +k^2\delta }

\begin{lemma}
\label{set_cover_solution_exists}
	If there exists solution for grid tiling,
	then there exists solution of instance $(\points, \sets, w)$
	of geometric set cover
	with weight $\solWeight$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
	If there exists a solution to the grid tiling problem
	$x, y$,
	then there exists a solution that covers
	all points
	$$\{h_{i, j, t} : 1 \le i, j \le k, t=order(x(i), y(j))\}
	\cup \{v_{i, j, t} : 1 \le i, j \le k, t=order(x(i), y(j))\}$$
	
	with $k^2$ segments from $DIAG$
	and the rest in $VER$ or $HOR$.
	This solution has weight $\solWeight$.
\end{proof}

\begin{claim}
\label{guards}
Points $p^{L}, p^R, p^U, p^D$ cannot be covered with
any segments from $DIAG$.
\end{claim}


\begin{claim}
\label{hor_ver_sound}
Points in $H \cup \{p^L : p \in H\} \cup \{p^R : p \in H\}$
have to be covered with sgements from $HOR$.

Points in $V \cup \{p^U : p \in V\} \cup \{p^D : p \in V\} $
have to be covered with segments from $VER$.
\end{claim}


\begin{claim}
\label{one_diag_in_square}
For given $1 \le i, j \le n$
and any solution of an instance instance $(\points, \sets, w)$
no two points $h_{i, j, t_1}, h_{i, j, t_2}$
($v_{i, j, t_1}, v_{i, j, t_2}$)
for $1 \le t_1 < t_2 \le n^2$
can be not covered with segments from $HOR$ ($VER$).
\end{claim}

\begin{proof}
Proof for horizontal segments. Proof for vertical is analoguous.

Assume point $h_{i, j, t_1}$ is not covered with
segments from $HOR$.
Point $h^R_{i, j, t_1}$ has to be covered with $HOR$
from Claim $\ref{hor_ver_sound}$.
And every segment in $HOR$ covering $h^R_{i, j, t_1}$,
covers also $h_{i, j, t_2}$.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{vertical_horizontal_sum}
For a constructed instance $(\points, \sets, w)$
any solution has to have sum of weights from sets $HOR$ and $VER$ at least
$2k^2(n^2+1) -4k^2\epsilon -4k(1-\epsilon))$.
Denote this weight as $W_{hv}$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
We know that for every $1 \le i,j \le k$
only one there exists only one $t_x$ and $t_y$ such that
$v_{i,j,t_x}$ and $h_{i,j,y}$
can be not covered by
segments from $HOR$ and $VER$ (Claim \ref{one_diag_in_square}),


We sum the lower bound for sum of length for horizontal/vertical
lines for a single vertical line
(the bound is the same for every horizontal line).

Let us fix $1 \le i \le k$.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Length between $v^D_{i, 1, 1}$ and $v^U_{i, k, n^2}$ is:
$$(k-2)(n^2+1) + 2(n^2 + \epsilon) = k(n^2+1) - 2(1 - \epsilon).$$

\item For every $1 \le j \le k$ there exists only one $1 \le t \le n$
such that $v_{i,j,t}$ is not covered by segments from $VER$
(Claim \ref{one_diag_in_square}).
Its guards $v^U_{i,j,t}$ and $v^D_{i,j,t}$
have to be covered in $VER$ (Claim \ref{guards}),
so only $k$ spaces of length $2\epsilon$ can be left
not covered by segments from $VER$.

\end{enumerate}
Therefore sum of these lower bounds for vertical and horizontal lines are:
$$2k(k(n^2+1) -2\epsilon -2(1-\epsilon)) =2k^2(n^2+1) -4k^2\epsilon -4k(1-\epsilon))$$
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{diag_correct}
For a constructed instance $(\points, \sets, w)$
for any solution for every $1 \le i,j \le k$
has to have at most one segment $DIAG$
connecting $v_{i,j,t}$ and $h_{i,j,t}$
such that $order^{-1}(t) \in f(i, j)$,
ie. it is a correct tile for $(i,j)$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
At most one $h_{i,j,t_x}$ and $v_{i,j,t_y}$
points are covered with $DIAG$
(Claim \ref{one_diag_in_square}).
	
Exactly one $h_{i,j,t_x}$ and $v_{i,j,t_y}$
points are covered with $DIAG$,
because if one of them were not, then we would use too much weight
$$W_hv + 2\epsilon > \solWeight$$

This points are covered with the same segment from $DIAG$,
because we need to use at least $k^2$ of them to use
exactly one DIAG segment for every pair of $1 \le i,j \le n$,
if we used 2 segments from $DIAG$
for one paur $(i,j)$,
then we would have used too much weight by $\delta$.


Therefore $t$ is allowed tile for $(i,j)$
because respective segment is in $DIAG$.

\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{vertical_horizontal_synchronized}
Points from previous point are synchronized in one row/column
$match_h(t_1,t_2)$ and $match_v(t_1,t_2)$ must be true
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
\begin{itemize}
\item Every space between points in H and V covered by HOR/VER
has to be covered by only one segment, because otherwise it would
use $\epsilon > k^2\delta$ additional weight, which is larger than
weight of solution
\item Therefore for every $t_1$ and $t_2$ that are consecutive
uncovered points, there must be a segment connecting
$h^R_{i,j,t_1}$ and $h^L_{i+1,j,t_2}$, because these points
have to be covered in HOR (Claim \ref{guards}),
therefore $match_h(t_1,t_2)$ must be true
\end{itemize}
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{grid_tiling_exists}
	If there exists solution  of instance $(\points, \sets, w)$
	of geometric set cover
	with weight at most $\solWeight$,
	then there exists a solution for grid tiling.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Therefore we take the points that are not covered in the solution
that we have and we know that for each row and colum
$order^{-1}(v_{i,*}) = x_i$ and we set $x(i) = x_i$,
$order^{-1}(h_{*,i}) = y_i$ and we set $y(i) = y_i$.
This is a solution to grid tiling problem.
\end{proof}

\begin{proof}[Proof of Theorem \ref{w1_hard}]
Based on Lemmas \ref{set_cover_solution_exists} and \ref{grid_tiling_exists}
this is true.
\end{proof}


\section{What is missing}
We don't know FPT for axis-parallel segments without $\delta$-extensions.
