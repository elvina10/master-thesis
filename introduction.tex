\chapter{Introduction}

Some of the problems are very well known to be NP-complete, like
Set Cover problem. Even so they still can have a variety
of different properties. Set Cover problem has been proven
in literature to be APX-hard and W[2]-hard \cite{platypus_book}.
We can also restrict a problem to look at it in various setting,
what can yield more insteresting complexity and apporximation results.
In this paper we take a closer look at Geometric Set Cover problem
on a plane, where points to cover are points on a plane
and sets to cover them with are geometric objects.

\paragraph{Approximation}
Over the years there have been a lot of work related to approximation
of Geometric Set Cover. Notabely 
Geometric Set Cover with unweighted unit disks admits PTAS, see
Corollary 1.1 in \cite{unit_disks}. When we consider the same problem
with weighted unit disks (or unit squares), the problem admits QPTAS
\cite{settling_apx_hardness}, later improved in
Theorem 2 in \cite{voronoi_true}.
Although \cite{rectangles_apx_hard} 
proves that cover with unweighted axis-parallel rectangles
is APX-hard as well as set cover with many other
standard geometric objects.

\paragraph{Parametrization}
We consider Geometric Set Cover 
parameterized by the size of solution in paremetrized setting.
Geomtric Set Cover with unit squares is proven to be W[1]-hard 
Theorem 5 in \cite{marx05}.

We also consider parametrization in weighted setting.
There does not seem to be a consensus of what parametrization
in weighted setting is exactly, there
was an attempt to introduce quite complicated general
framework of weighted parametrized setting in \cite{weighted_framework}.
Kernels for several well known weighted problems
such as Subset Sum or Knapsack are presented in \cite{kernel_weighted}.
Another work \cite{weighted_flow} presents weighted
parametrization of Weighted Directed Feedback Set and Weighted $st$-Cut.

\paragraph{$\delta$-extensions}
In this paper, we focus on Geometric Set Cover wih segments with $\delta$-extensions.
$\delta$-extensions is a problem relaxation method based on
$\delta$-shrinking model which was introduced in \cite{shrinking_original}
and used is later works \cite{shrinking1} and \cite{shrinking2}.

Similar model is used to prove that Geometric Set Cover with fat polygons
relaxed with $\delta$-extensions admits EPTAS \cite{harpeled12}.

\section*{Our contribution}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Approximation of uweighted geometric set cover with axis-parallel segments
(even if we relax it with  $\frac{1}{2}$-extensions) is APX-hard
(Theorem \ref{segment_cover_apx_hard})
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item Stronger result than cover with unweighted axis-parallel
	rectangles being APX-hard in \cite{rectangles_apx_hard}
	\item This proves that assumption about polgons being fat for
	the EPTAS in \cite{harpeled12} is a necessary condition
	\end{enumerate}
\item unweighted segments admit FPT algorithm (Theorem \ref{segment_cover_fpt})
\item weighted segments relaxed with $\delta$-extensions admit FPT (Theorem \ref{fpt_weighted_segment}),
    see Figure \ref{tab:weighted_fpt}
\item weighted axis-parallel segments is W[1]-hard (Theorem \ref{w1_hard}),
    see Figure \ref{tab:weighted_fpt}

\end{enumerate}

The Set Cover problem is one of the most common NP-complete problems.
[tutaj referencja]
We are given a family of sets and have to choose the smallest
subfamily of these sets that cover all their elements.
This problem naturally extends to settings
were we put different weights on the sets
and look for the subfamily of the minimal weight.
This problem is NP-complete even 
without weights and if we put
restrictions on what the sets can be.
One of such variants is Vertex Cover problem,
where sets have size 2 (they are edges in a graph).

In this work we focus on another such variant where the sets correspond
to some geometric shapes and
only some points of the plane have to be covered.
When these shapes are rectangles with edges parallel
to the axis, the problem can be proven to
be W[1]-complete (solution of size $k$ cannot be found
in $n^o(k)$ time),
APX-complete (for suffciently small $\epsilon > 0$, the problem
does not admit $1+\epsilon$-approximation scheme)
[refrencje].

Some of these settings are very easy.
Set cover with lines parallel to one of the axis
can be solved in polynomial time.

There is a notion of $\delta$-expansions,
which loosen the restrictions on geometric set cover.
We allow the objects to cover the points
after $\delta$-expansion and compare
the result to the original setting.
This way we can produce both FPT and EPTAS
for the rectangle set cover with $\delta$-extensions
[referencje].



\paragraph{Our contribution.}
In this work, we prove that unweighted geometric set cover
with segments is fixed parameter tractable (FPT).

Moreover, we show that geometric set cover with segments
is APX-complete for unweighted axis-parallel segments,
even with 1/2-extensions.
So the problem for very thin rectangles
also cannot admit PTAS.
Therefore, in the efficient polynomial-time approximation scheme (EPTAS)
for \textit{fat polygons} by \cite{harpeled12},
the assumption about polygons being fat is necessary. 

Finally, we show that geometric set cover with weighted segments in
3 directions is W[1]-complete.
However, geometric set cover with weighted segments is FPT if we allow
$\delta$-extension.

This result is especially interesting,
since it's counter-intuitive that
the unweighed setting is FPT and the weighted
setting is W[1]-complete.
Most of such problems (like vertex cover or [wiecej przykladow])
are equally hard in both weighted and unweighted settings.
