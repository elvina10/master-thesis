\caption{\textbf{VARIABLE-gadget.}
We denote the set of points marked with black circles as $\pointsVar{i}$,
and they need to be covered (are part of the set $\points$).
Note that some of the points are not marked as black dots
and exists only to name segments for further reference.
We denote the set of red segments as $\chooseVar{false}{i}$
and the set of blue segments as $\chooseVar{true}{i}$.}
