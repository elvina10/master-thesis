	In this thesis we analyze approximation
	and parametrization of $\GeometricSetCover$ with segments.
	To achieve interesting results we define a concept
	of $\GeometricSetCover$ with $\delta$-extension, where we
	need to cover the points by geometric objects,
	which are extended by a tiny fraction,
	but we compare the solution size to the optimum solution without extension.
	We prove that $\SegmentSetCover$ is APX-hard
	even if we restrict segments to be axis-pararell
	and allow $\frac{1}{2}$-extension (Chapter \ref{chapter:segment_apx}).
	We provide an FPT algorithm for unweighted $\SegmentSetCover$
	parametrized by the size of the solution $k$
	(Section \ref{section:fpt_unweighted})
	and for $\WeightedSegmentSetCover$ with $\delta$-extension
	(Section \ref{section:fpt_weighted}).
	Finally, we prove that $\WeightedSegmentSetCover$
	is W[1]-hard and there does not exist an algorithm running
	in time $f(k)\cdot n^{o(\sqrt{k})}$ solving this problem
	even if we restrict the segments to 3 directions
	(Chapter \ref{chapter:w1_hard}).
