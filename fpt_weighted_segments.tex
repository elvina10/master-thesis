\section{Fixed-parameter tractable algorithm for weighted segments with $\delta$-extensions}
\label{section:fpt_weighted}

In this section we consider the geometric set cover problem
for weighted segments relaxed with $\delta$-extensions.
We show that this problem
admits an FPT algorithm when parameterized by the size
of the solution and $\delta$.
In the next chapter we show that the assumption
about the problem being relaxed with $\delta$-extensions is necessary:
we prove that geometric set cover problem
for weighted segments (without extensions) is W[1]-hard, which means
there does not exist any FPT algorithm parameterized by solution size for it,
assuming FPT $\neq$ W[1].

\begin{tw}[FPT for weighted segment cover with $\delta$-extensions]{
	\label{fpt_weighted_segment}
	There exists an algorithm that given a family $\sets$ of
	$n$ weighted segments (in any direction),
	a set of $m$ points $\points$, and parameters $k$ and $\delta > 0$,
	such that it
	runs in time $f(k, \delta) \cdot (nm)^c$ for some computable function $f$ and a constant $c$ and
	outputs a set $\sol$ such that:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item $\sol \subseteq \sets$,
	\item $|\sol| \le k$,
	\item $\sol^{+\delta}$ covers all points in $\points$,
	\item the weight of $\sol$ is not greater than the weight
	of an optimum solution of size at most $k$
	for this problem without $\delta$-extensions
	\end{itemize}
	or determines that there is no set $\sol$ with $|\sol| \le k$
	such that $\sol$ covers all points in $\points$.
}\end{tw}


To solve this problem we will introduce a lemma about choosing
a \textit{dense} subset of points. A dense subset of points
for a set of collinear points $C$ and parameters $k$ and $\delta$
is a subset of $C$ such that
if we cover it with at most $k$ segments,
these segments after $\delta$-extensions will cover all of the points from $C$.
We will prove that such set 
of size bounded by some function $f(k, \delta)$
always exists (Lemma \ref{dense_set_exists}).
Later, Lemma \ref{dense_set_exists} will allow us to find a kernel
for our original problem.

\begin{defi}
	For a set of collinear points $C$,
	a subset $A \subseteq C$ is \textbf{$(k,\delta)$-dense} 
	if for any set of segments $R$ that covers $A$ and
	such that $|R| \le k$, it holds that $R^{+\delta}$ covers $C$.
\end{defi}

\begin{lemma}
	\label{dense_set_exists}
	For any set of collinear points $C$, $\delta > 0$ and $k \ge 1$,
	there exists a $(k,\delta)$-dense set $A \subseteq C$ of size
	at most $(2+\frac{2}{\delta})^k$.
	Moreover, there exists an algorithm that computes the $(k,\delta)$-dense set
	in time $O(|C| \cdot (2+\frac{2}{\delta})^k)$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
We prove this for a fixed $\delta$ by induction on $k$.

\subparagraph{Inductive hypothesis.}
For any set of collinear points $C$, there exists a set $A$ such that:
\begin{itemize}
\item $A$ is subset of $C$,
\item $A$ is $(\ell, \delta)$-dense for every $1 \le \ell \le k$,
\item $|A| \le (2+\frac{2}{\delta})^k$,
\item the extreme points of $C$ are in $A$.
\end{itemize}

\subparagraph{Base case for $k = 1$.}
It is sufficient that $A$ consists of the extreme points of $C$.

If they are covered with one segment, it must be a segment 
that includes the extreme points from $C$, so it covers the whole set $C$.

There are at most 2 extreme points in $C$ and $2 < 2+\frac{2}{\delta}$.

\subparagraph{Inductive step.}
Assuming inductive hypothesis for any set of collinear points $C$
and for parameter $k$, we will prove it for $k+1$.

Let $s$ be the minimal segment that includes all points from $C$.
That is, the extreme points of $C$ are endpoints of $s$.

We define $M = \lceil1+\frac{2}{\delta}\rceil$ subsegments of $s$
by splitting $s$ into $M$ closed segments of equal length.
We name these segments $v_i$, note that
$|v_i| = \frac{|s|}{M}$ for each $1 \le i \le M$.

Let $C_i$ be the subset of $C$ consisting of points lying on $v_i$.

Let $t_i$ be the segment with endpoints being the extreme points of $C_i$.
It might be a degenerate segment if $C_i$ consists of one point,
or $t_i$ might be empty if $C_i$ is empty.

Figure $\ref{fig:fpt_v_f_def}$ presents an example
of such segments $v_i$ and $t_i$.

Example for $M = 7$ and some set of points (marked with black circles).
The top panel shows segments $v_i$ and the bottom panel shows segments $t_i$
on the same set of points.
$a$ and $b$ are the extreme points and therefore segment $s$
ends at $a$ and $b$.
Red segments depict the split into $M$ segments of equal length $v_i$.
Blue segments depict the segments $t_i$. $t_5$ is an empty segment,
because there are no points that lie on segment $v_5$.
Segments $t_3$ and $t_7$ are degenerated to one point --
$c$ and $d$ respectively.
Segments $t_1$ and $t_2$ share one point $b$.
\label{fig:fpt_v_f_def}
\end{figure}

We use the inductive hypothesis to choose $(k, \delta)$-dense sets $A_i$
for sets $C_i$. Note that if $|C_i| \le 1$, then $A_i = C_i$
and it is still a $(k, \delta)$-dense set for $C_i$.

Then we define $A = \bigcup_{i=1}^{M} A_i$.
Thus $A$ includes the extreme points of $C$,
because they are included in the sets $A_1$ and $A_M$.

The size of each $A_i$ is at most $(2+\frac{2}{\delta})^{k}$
from the inductive hypothesis, therefore size of $A$ is at most:
$$M\left(2+\frac{2}{\delta}\right)^{k} =
\left\lceil1+\frac{2}{\delta}\right\rceil\cdot\left(2+\frac{2}{\delta}\right)^{k}
\le \left(2+\frac{2}{\delta}\right)^{k+1}.$$


\subparagraph{Proof that $A$ is $(k, \delta)$-dense for $C$.}
Let us take any cover of $A$ with $k+1$ segments and call it $\sol$.

For every segment $t_i$, if there exists a segment $x$ in $\sol$ 
that is disjoint with $t_i$,
then we have a cover of $A_i$ with at most $k$
segments using $\sol - \{x\}$.
Since $A_i$ is $(k, \delta)$-dense for $t_i$ and $C_i$,
$(\sol - \{x\})^{+\delta}$ covers $C_i$.
So $\sol^{+\delta}$ covers $C_i$ as well.

If there exists a segment $t_i$ for which a segment $x$ as defined above
does not exist, then all $k+1$ segments that cover
$A_i$ intersect $t_i$.
An example of such segments is depicted in Figure~\ref{fig:fpt_tricky_case}.
Let us consider any such $t_i$.
By inductive hypothesis, the endpoints of $s$ are
in $A_1$ and $A_M$ respectively, so $\sol$ must cover them.
For each endpoint of $s$, there exists
a segment that contains this endpoint and intersects $t_i$.
Let us call these two segments $y$ and $z$. It follows that:
$|y| + |z| + |t_i| \ge |s|$.
Since $|t_i| \le |v_i| = \frac{|s|}{M} \le \frac{|s|}{1+\frac{2}{\delta}} = \frac{|s|\delta}{\delta+2}$,
we have $\max(|y|, |z|) \ge |s|(1-\frac{\delta}{\delta+2})/2 = \frac{|s|}{\delta+2}$.

\begin{figure}[h]
\begin{center}
\def\svgwidth{\columnwidth}
\input{fpt_tricky_case.pdf_tex}
\end{center}
\caption{\textbf{Example of all $k+1$ segments intersecting one segment $t_i$.}}
Both panels show the same set $\points$ (black circles),
the same as in Figure $\ref{fig:fpt_v_f_def}$.
The top panel shows blue segments $t_i$ for $M=7$.
The bottom panel shows green segments -- solution $\sol$ of size 4.
All segments from $\sol$ intersect $t_4$.
Segments $z$ and $y$ are named in the figure.
\label{fig:fpt_tricky_case}
\end{figure}

After $\delta$-extension, the longer of these segments will
expand at both ends by at least:
$$\max(|y|, |z|)\delta \ge \frac{|s|\delta}{\delta+2} =
\frac{|s|}{1+\frac{2}{\delta}} \ge \frac{|s|}{M} = |v_i| \ge |t_i|.$$

Therefore, the longer of segments $y$ and $z$ will cover the whole segment $t_i$
after $\delta$-extension. We conclude that $\sol^{+\delta}$ covers $C_i$.

Since $C = \bigcup_{i=1}^M C_i$,
it follows that $\sol^{+\delta}$ covers $C$.


\subparagraph{Algorithm.}

We can simulate the inductive proof presented above by a recursive algorithm with
the following complexity:
$$O\left(|C|+\frac{1}{\delta}\right) + O\left(|C|\cdot\left(2+\frac{2}{\delta}\right)^k\right).$$

\end{proof}

Let us now formulate some claims about the
properties for the problem parameterized by the solution size.
These properties provide bounds for different
objects in the problem instance,
which help us to find a small kernel for the problem
or conclude that the optimum
solution to this instance must be in terms of size above some treshold.

\begin{defi}
A line in the plane is \textbf{long}
if there are at least $k+1$ points from $\points$ on it.
\end{defi}

\begin{claim}
\label{few_long_lines}
If there are more than $k$ different long lines, then 
$\points$ can not be covered with $k$ segments.
\end{claim}

\begin{proof}
We prove the claim by contradiction.
Let us assume that we have at least $k+1$ different
long lines in our instance of the problem
and there is a solution $\sol$ of size at most $k$
covering points $\points$.

Choose any long line $L$.
Every segment from $\sol$ which is not collinear with $L$,
covers at most one point that lies on $L$.
$L$ is long, so there are at least $k+1$ points from $\points$ that lie on $L$.
That implies that there must be a segment in $\sol$ that is
collinear with $L$.

Since we have at least $k+1$ different long lines,
there are at least $k+1$
segments in $\sol$ collinear with different lines.
This contradicts with the assumption that $|\sol| \le k$.
\end{proof}

\begin{claim}
\label{few_points}
If there are more than $k^2$ points from $\points$
that do not lie on any long line,
then $\points$ can not be covered with $k$ segments.
\end{claim}

\begin{proof}
We prove the claim by contradiction.
Let us assume that we have at least $k^2+1$ points
from $\points$ that do not lie on any long line, call this set $A$,
and a solution $\sol$ of size at most $k$
covering all points in $\points$.

Every segment $s$ from $\sol$ covers at most $k$
points from $A$.
This is because if $s$ covered at least $k+1$ points from $A$,
then the line in the direction of $s$ would be a long line
and that contradicts the definiton of $A$.

If every segment from $\sol$ covers at most $k$ points from $A$
and $|\sol| \le k$, then at most $k^2$ points from $A$ are covered by $\sol$
and that contradicts the fact that $\sol$ is a solution to the given
geometric set cover instance.
\end{proof}

We are now ready to give a proof of Theorem \ref{fpt_weighted_segment}.

\begin{proof}[Proof of Theorem \ref{fpt_weighted_segment}]
Our goal is to either answer \texttt{NO} or to find a kernel
$(\sets', \points')$ of bounded size, such that:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{(Property 1)} for every solution
$\sol$ to $(\sets, \points)$ of size at most $k$,
there exists a set $\sol_1 \subseteq \sets'$ such that
$\sol_1 \le k$, weight of $\sol_1$ is not greater than weight of $\sol$
and $\sol_1$ covers $\points'$;
\item \textit{(Property 2)}
for every set $\sol_2 \subseteq \sets'$ such that $|\sol_2| \le k$
and $\sol_2$ covers points in $\points'$, $\sol_2^{+\delta}$
covers points in original instance $\points$.
\end{itemize}

If we found such sets $(\sets', \points')$,
using \textit{Property 1} we know that optimum solution 
of size at most $k$ to $(\points', \sets')$
has no greater weight than optimum solution
of size at most $k$ to $(\points, \sets)$.
Using \textit{Property 2} we know that
any solution to $(\points', \sets')$
after $\delta$-extensions covers $\points$.

Therefore finding such sets in desired complexity
is sufficient to prove Theorem \ref{fpt_weighted_segment}.

\paragraph{Definition of $\points'$ and $\sets'$.}
Let us name the number of different long lines as $l$.
Applying Claims \ref{few_long_lines} and \ref{few_points},
if we have more than $k$ different long lines
or more than $k^2$ points from $\points$
that do not lie on any long line, then we answer \texttt{NO},
becase these lemmas prove that there is no solution of size at most $k$
to this instance.

Otherwise, we can split $\points$ into at most $k+1$ sets:
\begin{itemize}
\item $D$: points that do not lie on any long line, $|D| \le k^2$;
\item $C_i$ for $1 \le i \le l$: points that lie on the $i$-th long line, $|C_i| > k$.
\end{itemize}
Note that sets $C_i$ do not need to be disjoint.

Then for every set $C_i$ we can use Lemma \ref{dense_set_exists}
to obtain a $(k,\delta)$-dense set $A_i$
for $C_i$ with $|A_i| \le (2+\frac{2}{\delta})^k$.

We define $\points':= D \cup (\bigcup A_i)$. $\points'$ has size at most
$k^2 + k(2+\frac{2}{\delta})^k$.
We define $\sets'$ as
for every pair of points $\points'$, we can choose one segment from
$\sets$ that has the lowest weight
among segments that cover these points 
or decide that there is no segment that covers them.
There are at most $|\points'|^2$ different segments in $\sets'$,
Therefore both $\sets'$ and $\points'$ have size bounded
by some function $f(k)$.

\paragraph{Proof of Property 1.}
First, we prove that
for every set $\sol_2 \subseteq \sets'$ such that $|\sol_2| \le k$
and $\sol_2$ covers points in $\points'$, $\sol_2^{+\delta}$
covers points in original instance $\points$.

Let us take such a set $\sol_2$.

$\points$ is separated into several parts -- sets $D$ and $C_i$.
Points from $D$ are covered by $\sol_2$, because $D$ is part of $\points'$.
Each point from any $A_i$ is covered, because $A_i$ is a part of $\points'$;
$A_i$ is a $(k,\delta)$-dense set for $C_i$, therefore $\sol_2^{+\delta}$
covers all points in $C_i$. Therefore $\sol_2^{+\delta}$ covers
all points in $\points$.

\paragraph{Proof of Property 2.}
Secondly, we prove that for every solution
$\sol$ to $(\sets, \points)$ of size at most $k$,
there exists a set $\sol_1 \subseteq \sets'$ such that
$\sol_1 \le k$ and
$\sol_1^{+\delta}$ covers all points in $\points$ and
weight of $\sol_1$ is not greater than weight of $\sol$.

For every segment in $\sol$, say $s$,
let us look at the points from $\points'$ that lie on $s$
and call this set of points $F$.
$F$ is a set of collinear points for course.
We can cover $F$ with any segment that covers extreme points of $F$,
because all other points lie on the segment between these points.
Therefore we can replace $s$ with a segment $s'$
that has lowest weight among the points that cover extreme points of $F$.
Such a segment belongs to $\sets'$, because this is how it was defined.
Of course segment $s'$ also have weight no greater than weight of $s$,
because $s$ also covers $F$.

Therefore we produced the set $\sol_1$ that has the same size,
weight not greather than $\sol$ and it covers $\points'$.

\paragraph{Complexity}
We find solutin of $(\points', \sets')$ by iterating
over all possible subsets of $\sets$.
Finding sets $\sets'$ and $\points'$ and then solving 
problem for kernel has overall complexity
$(|\sets| + |\points|)^{O(1)}O((2 + \frac{2}{\delta})^k) + O((k^2 + k(2 + \frac{2}{\delta})^k)^k)$.
\end{proof}
