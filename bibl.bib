	abstract="An EPTAS (efficient PTAS) is an approximation scheme where $\epsilon$ does not appear in the exponent of n, i.e., the running time is f($\epsilon$)nc. We use parameterized complexity to investigate the possibility of improving the known approximation schemes for certain geometric problems to EPTAS. Answering an open question of Alber and Fiala [2], we show that Maximum Independent Set is W[1]-complete for the intersection graphs of unit disks and axis-parallel unit squares in the plane. A standard consequence of this result is that the {\$}n^{\{}O(1/{\{}{\backslash}it {\backslash}epsilon{\}}){\}}{\$}time PTAS of Hunt et al. [11] for Maximum Independent Set on unit disk graphs cannot be improved to an EPTAS. Similar results are obtained for the problem of covering points with squares.",
