	In this thesis we study approximation
	and parameterized algorithms for a variant of the $\SetCover$ problem,
	where the universe of elements to cover are points in the plane,
	and sets to cover objects with are segments.
	We call this problem $\SegmentSetCover$.
	We also consider the problem relaxed with $\delta$-extension,
	where we need to cover the points by segments,
	which are extended by a tiny fraction,
	but we compare the solution size to the optimum solution without extension.
	We prove that $\SegmentSetCover$ is APX-hard
	even if we restrict segments to be axis-parallel
	and allow $\frac{1}{2}$-extension.
	We provide FPT algorithms for unweighted $\SegmentSetCover$
	parameterized by the size of the solution $k$
	and for $\WeightedSegmentSetCover$ with $\delta$-extension.
	Finally, we prove that
	\textsc{Weighted} \textsc{Segment} \textsc{Set} \textsc{Cover}
	is W[1]-hard and there does not exist an algorithm running
	in time $f(k)\cdot n^{o(\sqrt{k})}$ solving this problem
	even if we restrict the segments to 3 directions.
